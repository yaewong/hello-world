# hello-world
This is my first repository.  Here I will store folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything my project needs, including a README file and license file.
My name is Yaelan Wong.  I live in the San Francisco Bay Area.  I teach middle school.  I like chocolate.
